\begin{definition}
  A scheme $X$ is \notion{projective} if it merely is a closed subtype of $\bP^n$ for some $n\in\N$.
\end{definition}

The goal of this section is to prove that projective space $\bP^n$ is compact,
a classical result of elimination theory.
We will first deal with the case $n = 1$, using algebraic methods, and
then deduce the general case.

The following lemma can be understood as a version of the Euclidean algorithm
for univariate polynomials in the abscence of decidable equality.
\begin{proposition}\label{euclid}
  Let $p_1, \ldots, p_n : R[X]$. Then we can find propositions
  $b_1,\ldots,b_r$, with each $b_i$ of the form $D(u) \wedge v_1 = \ldots = v_k = 0$,
  such that $\neg \neg (b_1 \vee \ldots \vee b_r)$,
  and for any $i$, we either have that $(p_1,\ldots,p_n) = 0$ if $b_i$ holds,
  or we have a natural $d$ such that if $b_i$ holds,
  then $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ is principal generated by a degree $d$ monic polynomial.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[sketch]
  We suppose each $p_i$ is represented by a list of coefficients.
  If one of these lists is empty, we simply throw it away.
  If there is no $p_i$ left,
  then there is nothing left to prove: we take $r = 1$ and $b_1 = D(1)$,
  and note that $(p_1,\ldots,p_n) = 0$.
  Thus we may suppose $n \ge 1$, and take $i$ such that the formal degree
  of $p_i$ is the smallest. Let $u$ be the leading coefficient of $p_i$.
  We have $\neg \neg (D(u) \vee u = 0)$. 
  In either case, we can make progress: if $D(u)$ and $n = 1$,
  then $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ is $(p_i)$ with $p_i$ monic;
  if $D(u)$ and $n > 1$, then we can divide the other $p_j$ by $p_i$,
  decreasing their formal degrees;
  and if $u = 0$ then we can reduce the formal degree of $p_i$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lorenzen}
  Let $A$ be an $R$-algebra, $J$ an ideal of $R$, and $x, y : A$ elements
  such that $xy = 1$. Suppose $1$ is in both $J[x]$ and $J[y]$.
  Then there is $m : J$  such that $m = 1$ in $A$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Write $1 = \sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i = \sum_{j=0}^m b_j y^j$.
  Multiplying by $y^j$, we have
  $y^j = \sum_{i=0}^n a_j x^i y^j$.
  For $0 \le j \le m$, we have
  $x^i y^j \in \{y^m,y^{m-1},\ldots,y,1,x,\ldots,x^n\}$, since $xy = 1$.
  Hence $\langle y^m,\ldots,1,\ldots,x^n \rangle = J\langle y^m,\ldots,1,\ldots,x^n\rangle$.
  By Nakayama, there is $m : J$ such that $m \cdot 1 = 1$ in $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{elim-xy}
  Let $U_1 : \bP^1\setminus\{0\} \to \Open$ and
  $U_2 : \bP^1\setminus\{\infty\} \to \Open$ be open subsets of the two affine patches
  of the projective line.
  Then there merely is an open proposition $\varphi$, such that
  if $(x : \bP^1\setminus\{0\}) \to U_1(x)$ and
  $(x : \bP^1\setminus\{\infty\}) \to U_2(x)$ both hold, then $\varphi$ also holds,
  and if $\varphi$ holds, then for all $x : \bP^1\setminus\{0,\infty\}$,
  $U_1(x) \vee U_2(x)$ holds.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By \cite[Theorem 4.2.7]{draft}, we have $U_1 = D(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ and
  $U_2 = D(q_1,\ldots,q_m)$, where $p_i \in R[X]$ and $q_i \in R[Y]$.
  By applying \cref{euclid} twice and combining the results, 
  we can find propositions
  $b_1,\ldots,b_r$ with each $b_i$ of the form
  $D(u) \wedge v_1 = \ldots = v_k = 0$,
  so that for each $i$, both $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ 
  and $(q_1,\ldots,q_m)$ are principal when $b_i$ holds
  (in the strong sense: we know what the degree will be even without knowing $b_i$).
 
  Consider now an $i$ such that if $b_i$ holds, then
  $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ and $(q_1,\ldots,q_m)$ are both the unit ideal.
  Write $b_i$ as $D(u) \wedge v_1 = \ldots = v_k = 0$.
  Since $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ is the unit ideal if $b_i$ holds,
  we have that $(R[X]/(p_1,\ldots,p_n))^{b_i} = R[X,u^{-1}]/(p_1,\ldots,p_n,v_1,\ldots,v_k)$
  is trivial.
  Thus $1 \in J[X]$ in $R[X,u^{-1}]/(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$
  where $J = \langle v_1,\ldots,v_k\rangle$.
  In $R[x,y,u^{-1}]/(xy-1,p_1(x),\ldots,p_n(x),q_1(y),\ldots,q_m(y))$,
  we thus have $1 \in J[x]$ and $1 \in J[y]$.
  By \cref{lorenzen}, we have $m' : J$ such that $m' = 1$ in
  this ring.
  This means we have $m : J$, $N : \N$ such that $u^N = m$
  in $R[x,y]/(xy-1,p_1(x),\ldots,q_m(y))$.
  We take $\varphi$ to be the disjunction of
  $D(u^N-m)$ over all such $i$.

  We first verify that $U_1$ and $U_2$ cover their respective
  affine patches, then $\varphi$ holds.
  That is, we have to derive a contradiction from the assumption
  that $u^N-m = 0$ in $R$ for each $i$ as above.
  Since our goal is $\neg \neg$-stable, we may suppose given $i$
  such that $b_i$ holds. 
	Since $U_1$ and $U_2$ cover their respective affine patches,
	we actually do have that $(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ and $(q_1,\ldots,q_m)$
	are both the unit ideal. Thus $i$ must be of the form above.
	But now $u$ is invertible and $m = 0$, contradicting $u^N-m = 0$.

	Next suppose $\varphi$ holds and $z : \bP^1 \setminus \{0,\infty\}$.
	We have to show $U_1(z) \vee U_2(z)$.
	We can write $z = [1 : x] = [y : 1]$ with $xy = 1$, so that
	we have to show
	$\neg (p_1(x) = \ldots = p_n(x) = q_1(y) = \ldots = q_m(y) = 0)$.
	Since we assume $\varphi$ holds, we can assume given an $i$
	such that $u^N - m$ is invertible in $R$.
	Since $u^N = m$ in
	the ring $R[x,y](xy-1,p_1,\ldots,q_m)$, this ring is trivial,
	so its spectrum is empty, as needed.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{p1-compact}
	The projective line $\bP^1$ is compact.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $U \subseteq \bP^1$ be open. Letting $U_1 = U \setminus\{0\}$ and
	$U_2 = U\setminus\{\infty\}$, take $\varphi$ as in \cref{elim-xy}.
	We claim that $(x : \bP^1) \to U(x)$ is equivalent to
	$U(0) \wedge U(\infty) \wedge \varphi$, which is clearly open.
	The forward implication is clear. For the reverse implication,
	observe that given $x : \bP^1$, we have
	$\neg \neg(x = 0 \vee x = \infty \vee \neg (x = 0 \vee x = \infty))$,
	and that $U(x)$ is $\neg \neg$-stable.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{Pn-compact}
	For each $n$, $\bP^n$ is compact.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	We have to show that for any $R$-module $V$ which is free of finite rank,
	$\bP V$ is compact. We induct on $m = \dim V$.
	For $m\le 1$, this is clear, since finite types are compact.
	Thus suppose $m \ge 2$, so that we may pick $u,v : V$ linearly independent.

	Say a \emph{flag} in $V$ of rank $r$ is a sequence
	$0 = W_0 \subseteq W_1 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq W_r$
	of submodules of $V$ such that $W_{i+1} / W_i$ is free of rank 1 for each $i$.
	Let $F_r$ be the type of flags in $V$ of rank $r$ such that $W_1$ is
	contained in $\langle u,v\rangle$.

	We claim that $F_r$ is compact for each $r$. We prove this by induction on $r$.
	For $r = 1$, we have $F_1 = \bP \langle u, v \rangle = \bP^1$, which
	is compact by \cref{p1-compact}.
	An element of $F_{r+1}$ is given by an element $W_0,\ldots,W_r$ of $F_r$
	together with a point of $\bP (V / W_r)$.
	Since $V / W_r$ is free of rank $m - r < m$, $\bP(V/W_r)$ is compact by inductive
	hypothesis. Thus $F_{r+1}$ is compact, since compact types are closed under $\Sigma$.

	We define a map $F_{m-1} \to \bP V^\star$, where $V^\star$ is the dual module of $V$.
	A point of $\bP V^\star$ is equivalently a surjection
	$V \to Q$ where $Q$ is free of rank 1, and indeed we have such a
	surjection $V \to V/W_{m-1}$ for any point of $F_{m-1}$.
	
	We claim that this map satisfies the assumptions for \cref{not-not-surjection-compact}.
	Say given a point of $\bP V^\star$. We can represent it
	by a linear map $c : V \to R$. It is not not the case that
	$c(w) = 0$ for some non-zero $w : \langle u, v \rangle$, for
	if $c(u) \ne 0$ then we can take $w = v - \frac{c(v)}{c(u)} u$.
	Given such a $w$, we can extend it to a basis of $\ker\, c$, defining the
	desired point of $F_{m-1}$.

	Putting everything together, we conclude that $\bP V^\star$ is compact.
	Since $V^\star = V$, $\bP V$ is also compact as needed.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Projective schemes are compact.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By \Cref{dependent-sum-compact}, \Cref{closed-proposition-compact} closed subtypes of a compact type are compact,
  so any closed subtype of $\bP^n$ is compact by \Cref{Pn-compact}.
\end{proof}

As there is no one-to-one correspondence of open and closed propositions in algebraic geometry,
our notion of compactness is generally different from having that existential quantifications over closed propositions is closed.
While we do not expect that this dual statement holds,
we have a useful approximations to the classical statement that images of compact schemes are closed
--- in particular for the case of a map between projective schemes:

\begin{remark}
  Let \(\varphi:X\to Y\) with \(X\) a compact scheme and \(Y\) a scheme.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Affine locally in \(Y\), the image of \(\varphi\) is contained in a closed subset,
    whose complement coincides with the complement of the image.
  \item If \(Y\) is projective, there is a closed subset \(V\subseteq Y\) such that
    \(\im(\varphi)\subseteq V\) and the complement of \(V\) coincides with the complement of \(\im(\varphi)\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is almost the same for (a) and (b).
  By compactness of \(X\), the complement of \(\im(\varphi)\) is open\footnote{This is the only use of compactness and the result could also be formulated for images of schemes with open complement.}.
  So affine locally it is of the form \(D(f_1,\dots,f_l)\) for some \(f_i:R[X_1,\dots,X_n]\).
  In the case \(Y\equiv \bP^n\), we have homogenous polynomials \(f_i\) with the analogue property.
  So \(V\colonequiv V(f_1,\dots,f_l)\) is a closed subset such that \(\neg V=\neg\im(\varphi)\),
  it might just be the case that \(V\) does not contain all of \(\im(\varphi)\).
  But for all \(x:X\), we have \(\neg\neg V(\varphi(x))\), which means \(\neg\neg f_1(\varphi(x))=0,\dots,\neg\neg f(\varphi(x))=0\) or equivalently, that all \(f_i(\varphi(x))\) are nilpotent.
  By boundedness, there is an \(n:\N\), such that for all \(x:X\), we have \(f_i(\varphi(x))^n=0\).
  So \(V(f_1^n,\dots,f_l^n)\) is a solution.
  Since every projective scheme merely is a closed subset of \(\bP^n\), we can conclude (b).
\end{proof}
