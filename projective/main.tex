\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Synthetic algebraic geometry is a new approach to algebraic geometry. It consists in using homotopy type theory extended with three axioms, together with the interpretation of these in a higher version of the Zariski topos, in order to do algebraic geometry internally to this topos.
  
  In this article, we will show basic properties of projective n-space $\bP^n$ in synthetic algebraic geometry.
  In particular, we show that the automorphism group of $\bP^n$ is $\PGL_{n+1}(R)$ and that the picard group is $\Z$.
  We will provide different proofs of the latter statement, where the most synthetic approach naturally leads to the refined statement that the type of line bundles on $\bP^n$ is the higher type $\Z\times K(R^\times,1)$, where $K(R^\times,1)$ is a delooping of the group of units of the internal base ring $R$.
