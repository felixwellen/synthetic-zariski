We follow the notations and setting for Synthetic Algebraic Geometry \cite{draft}.
In particular, $R$ denotes the generic local ring and $R^\times$ is the multiplicative group of units of $R$.

In Synthetic Algebraic Geometry, a scheme is defined as a set satisfying some property \cite[Definiton 5.1.1]{draft}. In particular
the projective space $\bP^n$ can be defined to be the quotient of $R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$ by the
equivalence relation $a\sim b$ which expresses that $a$ and $b$ are proportional, i.e.\ $a_ib_j=a_jb_i$. This proportionality is a closed proposition which is equal to $\Sigma_{r:R^\times}ar = b$.
We can then prove \cite[Theorem 6.1.5]{draft} that this set is a scheme. This definition goes back to \cite{Kock74}.

 In this setting, a map of schemes is simply an arbitrary set theoretic map. An application of this work is to show
 that the maps $\bP^n\rightarrow \bP^m$ are given by $m+1$ homogeneous polynomials of the same degree in $n+1$ variables.

\medskip


There is another definition of $\bP^n$ which uses ``higher'' notions. Let $\KR= K(R^\times,1)$ be the delooping
of $R^\times$. It can be defined as the type of lines $\Sigma_{M:\Mod{R}}\|{M=R^1}\|$. Over $\KR$ we have the
family of sets
$$E_n(l) = l^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$$
Note that we use the same notation for an element $l : \KR$,
its underlying $R$-module and its underlying set.
An equivalent definition of $\bP^n$ is then
$$
\bP^n = \sum_{l:\KR}E_n(l)
$$
This is a general construction of the \emph{homotopy} quotient of a type by a group action --
the type in this case is $E(R^1)=R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$ and the action of $R^\times=\GL(1,R)=\Omega (\KR,R^1)$ is given by transporting in $E(R^1)$ along a loop $l:\Omega (\KR,R^1)$.
One can calculate, that this transport and therefore the action corresponds to scalar multiplication.
Since this is a free group action, the homotopy quotient, given by the sigma type above, will be a set.
This is part of the homotopy typetheoretic view on group theory and group actions, which is explained in detail in \cite{Sym}.

We will use the following constructions of $\bP^n$ and the identifications between them given below:
\begin{remark}\label{identification-Pn}
  Projective $n$-space $\bP^n$ is given by the following equivalent constructions of which we prefer
  the first in this article:
  \begin{center}
  
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\sum_{l:\KR}E_n(l)$
    \item The set-quotient $R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}/R^\times$, where $R^\times$ acts on non-zero vectors in $R^{n+1}$ by multiplication.
    \item For any $k$ and $R$-module $V$ we define the \emph{Grassmannian}
      \[ \Gr(k,V)\colonequiv \{ U\subseteq V \mid \text{$U$ is an $R$-submodule and $\|U=R^k\|$ }\} \rlap{.}\]
      Projective $n$-space is then $\Gr(1,R^{n+1})$.
    \end{enumerate}
    
  \end{center}
  We use the following, well-defined identifications:
  \begin{center}
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[] (i)$\to$(iii): Map $(l,s)$ to $R\cdot (u s_0,\dots, u s_n)$ where $u:l=R^1$
  \item[] (iii)$\to $(i): Map $L\subseteq R^{n+1}$ to $(L, x)$ for a non-zero $x\in L$
  \item[] (ii)$\leftrightarrow$ (iii): A line through a non-zero $x:R^{n+1}$
          is identified with $[x]:R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}/R^\times$
  \end{enumerate}
    
  \end{center}
\end{remark}

We construct the standard line bundles $\OO(d)$ for all $d\in\Z$,
which are classically known as \emph{Serre's twisting sheaves} on $\bP^n$ as follows:

\begin{definition}
  For $d:\Z$, the line bundle $\OO(d):\bP^n\to \KR$ is given by $\OO(d)(l,s) = l^{\otimes d}$
  and the following definition of $l^{\otimes d}$ by cases:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item $d \geqslant 0$: $l^{\otimes d}$ using the tensor product of $R$-modules
  \item $d < 0$: $(l^{\vee})^{-d}$, where $l^{\vee}\colonequiv\Hom_{\Mod{R}}(l,R^1)$ is the dual of $l$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

This definition of $\OO(d)$ agrees with \cite{draft}[Definition 6.3.2] where $\OO(-1)$
is given on $\Gr(1,R^{n+1})$ by mapping submodules of $R^{n+1}$ to $\KR$.
Using the identification of $\bP^n$ from \Cref{identification-Pn} we can give the following explicit equality:

\begin{remark}
  We have a commutative triangle:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        \sum_{l:\KR} E_n(l)\ar[rr]\ar[dr,swap,"\OO(1)"] && R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}/R^\times\ar[ld,"\OO(1)"] \\
                  & \KR &
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

by the isomorphism given for $(l,s)$ by mapping $x:l$ to $r(u s_0,\dots, u s_n)\mapsto r(u x)$ for some isomorphism $u:l\cong R^1$.
\end{remark}

\medskip

 Connected to this definition of $\bP^n$, we will prove some equalities in the following.
 To prove these equalities, we will make use of the following lemma, which holds in synthetic algebraic geometry:
 
\begin{lemma}\label{invariant-implies-homogenous}
  Let $n,d:\N$ and $\alpha:R^n\to R$ be a map such that
  \[\alpha(\lambda x)=\lambda^d\alpha(x)\]
  then $\alpha$ is a homogenous polynomial of degree $d$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By duality, any map $\alpha:R^n\to R$ is a polynomial.
  To see it is homogenous of degree $d$, let us first note that any $P:R[\lambda]$ with $P(\lambda)=\lambda^d P(1)$
  for all $\lambda:R^\times$ also satisfies this equation for all $\lambda : R$ and is therefore homogenous of degree $d$.
  Then for $\alpha'_x:R[\lambda]$ given by $\alpha'_x(\lambda)\colonequiv \alpha(\lambda\cdot x)$
  we have $\alpha'_x(\lambda)=\lambda^d \alpha'_x(1)$. This means any coeffiecent of $\alpha'_x$
  of degree different from $d$ is 0. Since this means every monomial appearing in $\alpha$,
  which is not of degree $d$, is zero for all $x$ and therefore 0.   
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{end}
  $$\prod_{l:\KR}l^n\rightarrow l \;\;\;=\;\;\; \Hom(R^n,R)$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We rewrite $\Hom(R^n,R)$, the set of $R$-module morphism, as
$$
\sum_{\alpha:R^n\rightarrow R}\prod_{\lambda:R^\times}\prod_{x:R^n}\alpha(\lambda x) = \lambda \alpha(x)
$$
using \Cref{invariant-implies-homogenous} with $d=1$.

\medskip


It is then a general fact that if we have a pointed connected groupoid $(A,a)$ and a family of
sets $T(x)$ for $x:A$, then $\prod_{x:A}T(x)$ is the set of fixed points of $T(a)$ for the $\Omega(A,a)$-action: If we have $f:\prod_{x:A}T(x)$, then for any $g:\Omega(A,a)$ we have $g(f_a)=f_a$ by depedent application of $f$ to $g$. And if $z:T(a)$ is a fixed point and $x:A$, the transport along a $p:a=x$ is independent of $p$, so we can construct a $z':T(x)$.
\end{proof}

We will use the following remark, proved in \cite{draft}[Remark 6.2.5].

\begin{lemma}\label{ext}
  Any map $R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}\rightarrow R$ can be uniquely extended to a map $R^{n+1}\rightarrow R$ for $n>0$.
\end{lemma}

We will also use the following proposition, already noticed in \cite{draft}.

\begin{proposition}\label{const}
  Any map from $\bP^n$ to $R$ is constant.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Since $\bP^n$ is a quotient of $R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}$, the set $\bP^n\rightarrow R$ is
  the set of maps $\alpha:R^{n+1}\setminus\{0\}\rightarrow R$
  such that $\alpha(\lambda x) = \alpha(x)$ for all $\lambda$ in $R^\times$.
  These are exactly the constant maps
  using \Cref{ext} and \Cref{invariant-implies-homogenous} with $d=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{aut}
  For all $n:\N$ we have:
$$\prod_{l:\KR}E_n(l)\rightarrow E_n(l) \;\;=\;\; \GL_{n+1}$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  For $n=0$, this is the direct computation that a Laurent-polynomial $\alpha:(R[X,1/X])^\times$ which satisfies
  $\alpha(\lambda x)=\lambda \alpha(x)$ is $\lambda\alpha(1)$ where $\alpha(1):R^\times=\GL_1$.
  
  \medskip
  
  For $n>0$, the proposition follows from two remarks.

  The first remark is that maps $E_n(R)\to E_n(R)$, which are invariant under the induced $\KR$ action, are linear.
  To prove this remark, we first map from $E_n(l)\to E_n(l)$ to $E_n(l)\to l^{n+1}$ by composing with the inclusion.
  Maps of the latter kind can be uniquely extended to maps $l^{n+1}\to l^{n+1}$, since by 
  \Cref{ext} the restriction map
$$
(l^{n+1}\rightarrow l)\rightarrow ((l^{n+1}\setminus\{0\})\rightarrow l)
$$
is a bijection for $n>0$ and all $l:\KR$.

\medskip

The second remark is that a linear map $u:R^{m}\rightarrow R^{m}$ such that
$$
x\neq 0~\rightarrow~u(x)\neq 0
$$
is exactly an element of $\GL_{m}$.

We show this by induction on $m$. For $m=1$ we have $u(1)\neq 0$ iff $u(1)$ invertible.

For $m>1$, we look at $u(e_1) = \Sigma \alpha_ie_i$ with $e_1,\dots,e_m$ basis of $R^m$.
We have that some $\alpha_j$ is invertible.
By composing $u$ with an element in $\GL_m$, we can then
assume that $u(e_1) = e_1+v_1$ and $u(e_i) = v_i$, for $i>1$, with $v_1,\dots,v_m$ in $Re_2+\dots+Re_m$.
We can then conclude by induction.
\end{proof}

We can generalize \Cref{end}
and get a result related to \Cref{aut} as follows.
 
\begin{lemma}\label{hom}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item
      \[  \prod_{l:\KR}l^n\rightarrow l^{\otimes d} \;\;=\;\; (R[X_1, \dots, X_n])_d \]
      That is,
      every element of the left-hand side is given by
      a unique homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $n$ variables.
    \item
      An element in
      $$\prod_{l:\KR}E_n(l)\rightarrow E_m(l^{\otimes d})$$
      is given by $m+1$ homogeneous polynomials $p = (p_0,\dots,p_m)$ of degree $d$ such that
      $x\neq 0$ implies $p(x)\neq 0$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We show the first item. Following \cite{Sym} again, this product is the set of maps $\alpha:R^n\rightarrow R^{\otimes d}$
which are invariant by the $R^\times$-action which in this case acts by mapping $\alpha$ to $r^d\alpha(r^{-1} x)$ for each $r:R^\times$.
So by \Cref{invariant-implies-homogenous} these are exactly the maps given by homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$.
\end{proof}
