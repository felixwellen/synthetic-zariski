\title{Synthetic Stone Duality}

\maketitle

%\begin{abstract}
%In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
%In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
%Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%%the opposite category of these 
%the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos in univalent homotopy type theory \cite{hott}. 
%In this work, we propose similar axioms, which we expect to be modelled by light condensed sets. 
%% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space
%% which is cool because reasons

\tableofcontents

% Logic and Topology
% - Building blocks, explaining the types of Stone, Boole (and what we mean with countable)
% - Rules, stating the axioms and first consequences, including the omniscience principles
% - Topology on propositions, mentioning under what constructions open propositions are closed
% - Examples of closed/open propositions, explaining why Boole is discrete and Stone Hausdorff
% - Topology on Stone spaces, including the classification of closed spaces.
% - Compact Hausdorff spaces. 
% Directed Univalence
% - Tychonov
% - Directed univalence, link to Phoa
% Cohomology
% - Cohomology and the interval
% Appendix, 
%  - alternative formulations of axiom 2
%  - more details on technical constructions
%  - colimit presentation of countably presented Boolean algebras (I'm not sure where we actually use this)
%  - scott continuity instead of axiom 1
