\subsection{Compact Hausdorff spaces are stable under dependent sums}

\begin{lemma}
A type $X$ is Stone iff it is merely a closed in $2^\N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Any countably presented boolean algebra $B$ is enumerable, which gives a surjective morphism:
$$ 2[\N]\to B$$
so that by \Cref{DualCompleteness} we merely have a closed embedding:
$$ Sp(B)\to 2^\N$$
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{SigmaStoneCompactHausdorff}
Assume given $S:\Stone$ and $T:X\to \Stone$. Then $\Sigma_{x:S}T(x)$ is Compact Hausdorff.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{ClosedDependentSums} we have that identity type in $\Sigma_{x:S}T(x)$ are closed.

We know that for any $x:S$ we have that $\exists_{C:2^\N\to \Closed} T_x = \Sigma_{y:2^\N}C(y)$. Using local choice we get $S':\Stone$ with a surjective map:
$$q:S'\to S$$
and:
$$ C : S'\to 2^\N\to\Closed$$
such that for all $x:S'$ we have $T(q(x)) = \Sigma_{y:2^\N}C(x,y)$. This gives a surjective map:
$$ \Sigma_{x:S'}\Sigma_{y:2^\N} C(x,y)\to \Sigma_{x:S}T(x)$$
The source is Stone by \Cref{StoneClosedUnderPullback} and \Cref{ClosedInStoneIsStone} so we can conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Assume given $C:\CHaus$ and $D:X\to \CHaus$. Then $\Sigma_{x:C}D(x)$ is Compact Hausdorff.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{ClosedDependentSums} we have that identity type in $\Sigma_{x:C}D(x)$ are closed.

We know that for any $x:C$ we have that $\exists_{T:\Stone} T\twoheadrightarrow C(x)$. Using a surjective map:
$$ S\to C$$
with $S:\Stone$ and local choice we get $S':\Stone$ with a surjective map:
$$q:S'\to C$$
such that for all $x:S'$ we have $T(x):\Stone$ and a surjective map $T(x)\to D(q(x))$. This gives a surjective map:
$$ \Sigma_{x:S'}T(x)\to \Sigma_{x:C}D(x)$$
By \Cref{SigmaStoneCompactHausdorff} we have a surjective map from a Stone space to the source so we can conclude.
\end{proof}
