\begin{definition}
  Let $S$ be Stone, $C\subseteq S$. 
  Then $C$ is open if it is the countable union of decidable subsets. 
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  For $S$ Stone and $C\subseteq S$, 
  $C$ is closed iff it's complement is open 
  and $C$ is open iff it's complement is closed. 
\end{lemma}



\begin{proof}
  This follows from the fact that the complement of a decidable subset is decidable and 
  \Cref{LemDecidableSubsetsDeMorgan}.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
  For $S$ Stone, any cover by opens merely has a finite subcover.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $S= \bigcup_{i:I} A_i$ be a cover of $S$ by open sets. 
  Assume furthermore $S= Sp(B)$. 
  As every open is the union of decidable subsets, we may assume $A_i$ decidable, 
  and thus corresponding to points $a_i \in B$. 
  These points are such that $1 = \bigvee_{i:I} a_i$. 
  As $B$ is countably presented, it is countable. 
  Thus $(a_i)_{i:I}$ is a countable set. 
  The morphism $I\to B$ is surjective, and as we're proving a proposition,
  we may use type-theoretic AC to give 
  a countable subset $I_0 \subseteq I$ such that $\bigvee_{i:I_0} a_i = 1$ as well. 
  So $S = \bigcup_{i:I_0} A_i$ for $I_0$ countable. 
\end{proof}

Note that the basic clopens are not the only clopens. 
I.e. not every set that is both a countable intersection of decidable subsets and 
a countable union of decidable subset is itself decidable. 
In $B_\infty$, we can describe the even numbers both as the infinite meet of cofinite sets excluding odd numbers up to $n$
and the join of finite sets including even numbers up to $n$. 
But the even numbers do not themselves for an element of $B_\infty$.
Thus the set of maps $B\to 2$ sending every $\chi_{2n}$ to $1$ is clopen but not decidable.

%\begin{lemma}
%  For $S$ Stone, any collections of closed sets satisfying the finite intersection property 
%  has a merely inhabited intersection. 
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  Suppose that $a_i$ is a collection of points such that $a_i \wedge a_j \neq 0$ whenever $i\neq j$. 
%  We claim that $\bigwedge a_i \neq 0$. 
%  Suppose $\bigwedge a_i = 0$.

\begin{definition}
We define a type $X$ to be compact Hausdorff iff 
$X$ is the quotient of a stone space $S$ by a closed equivalence relation. 
%there is a surjection $e:S\to X$ for $S$ Stone. 
%
A subtype $C\subseteq X$ is closed respectively open iff it's pre-image under the quotient map is. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  In a compact Hausdorff, closed sets are closed under intersection. 
\end{lemma}








%\begin{lemma}
%  Let $X$ be a Compact Hausdorff type, 
%  and suppose that $(A_i)_{i:I}$ is a collection of opens in $X$ such that 
%  $X = \bigcup_{i:I} A_i$. 
%  There then exists a finite subset $I_0\subseteq I$ with 
%  $X = \bigcup_{i:I_0} A_i$. 
%\end{lemma} 

\begin{lemma}
  In a Compact Hausdorff space, the complement of an open is closed, and the complement of a closed is open. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $e : S \to X$ be the quotient map of a Stone space by a closed equivalence relation. 
  and let $(A_n)_{n:\N}$ be a countable family of decidable subsets in $S$. 

  First, we claim that 
  $X - \bigcup_{n:\N} e(A_n)$
  is closed in $X$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Whenever $X$ is compact Hausdorff, $F_0, F_1$ are closed and disjoint, 
  there exist $G_0, G_1$ disjoint clopen such that 
  $F_i \subseteq X - G_{1-i}$ and $G_0 \cup G_1 = X$. 
  
\end{lemma}
