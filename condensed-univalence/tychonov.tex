\subsection{Tychonov}

\begin{theorem}[Tychonov]
Assume given $I$ overtly discrete and $C_i$ compact Hausdorff depending on $i:I$. Then:
\[\prod_{i:I}C_i\]
is compact Hausdorff.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We can assume $I = \mathrm{colim}_{k:\N}\mathrm{Fin}(l_k)$. Then:
\[\prod_{i:I}C_i = \prod_{i:\mathrm{colim}_{k:\N}\mathrm{Fin}(l_k)} C_i = \lim_{k:\N} C_i^{l_k}\]
and we can conclude using that compact Hausdorff spaces are stable under sequential limits and finite products.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Tychonov's dual}

\begin{lemma}\label{tychonov-dual-auxiliary}
Assume $p:C\to D$ a surjective map with $C$ and $D$ compact Hausdorff. Given $I_x$ overtly discrete depending on $x:D$, if:
\[\prod_{x:C}I_{p(x)}\]
is overtly discrete then so is:
\[\prod_{x:D}I_x\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since the map is surjective we have an embedding:
\[\prod_{x:D}I_x\subset \prod_{x:C}I_{p(x)}\]
But the fiber over $g:\prod_{x:C}I_{p(x)}$ is:
\[\forall (x,y:C). p(x)=p(y) \to g(x)=g(y)\]
which is open by \cref{compact-hausdorff-compact}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Tychonov's dual]\label{tychonov-dual}
Assume given $C$ compact Hausdorff and $I_x$ overtly discrete depending on $x:C$. Then:
\[\prod_{x:C}I_x\]
is overtly discrete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By local choice and \cref{tychonov-dual-auxiliary} we can assume that $C$ is Stone (so we denote $C$ by $S$) and that we have towers of finite types $(\mathrm{Fin}(l_{k,x}))_{k:\N}$ such that for all $x:S$ we have that:
\[I_x = \mathrm{colim}_k\mathrm{Fin}(l_{k,x})\] 
Then using \cref{scott-continuity-right} and the fact that overtly discrete types are stable under sequential colimits, it is enough to prove that for $S$ Stone and $l_x:\N$ depending on $x:S$ we have that:
\[\prod_{x:S}\mathrm{Fin}(l_{x})\]
is overtly discrete. 

Using boundedness, the fact that:
\[S_k = \left(\Sigma_{x:S} l_x = k\right)\] 
is Stone and that overtly discrete types are stable under finite products, we just have to prove that for any $l:\N$ and $S$ Stone we have that:
\[S\to \mathrm{Fin}(l)\]
is overtly discrete. We can conclude using that \cref{factorisation-stone-finite} and that Stone are limits of finite types.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Factorisation}

\begin{theorem}[Factorisation]
Let $C$ be compact Hausdorff and $I$ be overtly discrete. Then any map:
\[C\to I\]
merely factors through a finite type.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is a direct consequence of \cref{scott-continuity} and $I$ being a sequential colimit of finite types.
\end{proof}
