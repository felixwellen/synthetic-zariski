Classically, there is no abelian category of coherent $\mathcal O_X$-modules over a general base.
Synthetically, the category of finitely presented modules over $R$ does not have all kernels,
since $R$ is not coherent, so module bundles with values in finitely presented modules are not abelian.

This section is about finding a suitable replacement category.
This section is joint work of Felix Cherubini, Dan Christensen and Thomas ThorbjÃ¸rnsen.
The work in this section profited from discussions with Hugo Moeneclaey and Mohamed Barakat.
\rednote{This is work in progress and "coherent" is a bad, preliminary name for the modules introduced in this section.}

\begin{theorem}
  For an $R$-module $M$ let $M^\ast\colonequiv \Hom_{\Mod{R}}(M,R)$ be its dual.
  Then dualizing a finite co-presentation of $M$:
  \[ M \hookrightarrow R^n \to R^m \]
  yields a finite presentation:
  \[ R^m \to R^n \twoheadrightarrow M^\ast \]
  This induces an anti-equivalence between finitely presented $R$-modules and finitely co-presented $R$-modules. In particular, the canonical map into the double dual, $M\to M^{\ast\ast}$ is an isomorphims for finitely presented and finitely co-presented $R$-modules.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \cite{diffgeo-article}
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
  \label{presentation-extension}
  Let $M,N$ be finitely presented and $f:M\to N$.
  Then there is an extension of this morphism to all presentations of $M$ and $N$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      R^{m'}\ar[r]\ar[d,dotted,"\exists"] & R^m\ar[->>,r,"\pi_M"]\ar[d,dotted,"\exists"] & M\ar[d, "f"] \\ 
      R^{n'}\ar[r] & R^n\ar[->>,r,"\pi_N"] & N \\ 
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  By dualizing, the analogous statement holds for finitely co-presented modules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By linear extension: For a standard basis vector $e_i:R^m$ we merely have $y:R^n$ such that $\pi_N(y)=f(\pi_M(e_i))$. By exactness, we also get $R^{m'}\to R^{n'}$ by linear extension.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{kernel-fp-is-cok-fcp}       
  Let $f:M\to N$ be a map of finitely presented $R$-modules, then $\ker f$ is the cokernel of map between finitely copresented $R$-modules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By \Cref{presentation-extension} we can assume $f$ is induced by a square and we construct finitely copresented modules $A,B$ like described below:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A\ar[r,"\pi_1"]\ar[d,"l\times\id"] & R^{m'}\ar[r,"t"]\ar[d,"l"] & R^{n'}\ar[d,"r"]   \\
    B\ar[r,"\pi_1"]\ar[d] & R^m\ar[r,"b"]\ar[d] & R^n\ar[d] \\
    K\ar[r] &M\ar[r,"f"] & N
    \end{tikzcd}
   \end{center}
   $A:=\{(z,y):R^{m'}\times R^{n'}\mid blz=ry\}$, $B:=\{(x,y):R^{m}\times R^{n'}\mid bx=ry\}$.
\end{proof}

We name the following modules after Adelman, since it will turn out that what we construct agrees with the free abelian category on the finite free $R$-modules, and our construction is close to Adelman's general construction of the free abelian category.

The idea is that they might yield an replacement of the algebro-geometric notion of coherent sheaf of modules, which would be a trivial notion over $R$.  

\begin{definition}
  Let $M$ be an $R$-module, then $M$ is an \notion{Adelman-module} if one of the following equivalent statements hold:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item $M$ is merely the kernel of a homomorphism of finitely presented $R$-modules.
  \item $M$ is merely the cokernel of a homomorphism of finitely copresented $R$-modules.
  \item $M$ is the image of a map from a finitely co-presented $R$-module to a finitely presented $R$-module.
  \item $M$ is in the smallest abelian subcategory of $\Mod{R}$ that contains all finite free $R$-modules.
  \end{enumerate}
  We denote the type of Adelman-modules with $\Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}$\index{$\Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}$}, as well as the category of these modules.
\end{definition}
We will show the equivalence of statement (iii) and the first two in ??.
The equivalence with (iv) will follow from \Cref{coherent-R-modules-abelian}.
(iii) will turn out to be self-dual.

\begin{remark}
  Any Adelman-module is wqc (\cite{draft}[Definition 7.1.5]).
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  By \cite{draft}[7.1.6, 7.1.13], the category of wqc $R$-modules is abelian and it contains finite free $R$-modules.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{coherent-double-dual-mono}
  For any Adelman-module $K$, the double dualization map $K\to K^{\ast\ast}$ is a monomorphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A$ and $B$ be finitely co-presented $R$-modules with a homomorphism $f:A\to B$ such that $K$ is the kernel, then we have the following diagram, which we will explain below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
  B\ar[r,"\sim"] & B^{\ast\ast} \\   
  A\ar[r,"\sim"]\ar[u,"f"] & A^{\ast\ast}\ar[u,"f^{\ast\ast}"] \\   
  K\ar[r,"i"]\ar[u,hook]\ar[ur,hook] & K^{\ast\ast}\ar[u]\ar[l,dotted,bend left=20,"p"] \\   
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
$K$ is also the kernel of $f^{\ast\ast}$ by the indicated composition.
By the universal property of this kernel, the dotted map exists and we have $p\circ i=\id$.
\end{proof}

The following lemma will eventually imply that finitely co-presented $R$-modules are projective and, by duality, finitely presented $R$-modules are injective.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{maps-into-coherent-lift}
  Let $A$ and $B$ be finitely co-presented $R$-modules, $K$ be a Adelman-module and $e:A\to K$ a epimorphism.
  Then there is a lift for any homorphism $f:A\to K$.
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
         & C\ar[d,->>,"e"] \\
       A\ar[r,"f"]\ar[ru,dotted,"\exists"] & K 
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We will proof the lemma using the following steps:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item \label{coherent-fcp-lift-existence} There is a lift on the level of the underlying sets, i.e.\ a map $\tilde{f}$ as indicated in the commutative diagram, which is not necessarily $R$-linear:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}
         & C\ar[d,->>,"e"] \\
       A\ar[r,"f"]\ar[ru,dotted,"\exists \tilde{f}"] & K 
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
  \item Any lift $\tilde{f}$ from \ref{coherent-fcp-lift-existence} can be decomposed into a $R$-linear part $f_L:A\to C$, and a non-linear part $f_{NL}\coloneq\tilde{f}-f_L$.
  \item $e$ maps $f_{NL}$ to $0$, so $f_L$ is a $R$-linear lift.
  \end{enumerate}
  Will we ill now proof these statements.
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Let $M$ be the kernel of $e$, then $M$ is wqc.
  By \cite{draft}[Theorem 7.3.6] we have $H^1(A,M)=0$, since $A$, like any finitely co-presented $R$-module, is an affine scheme.

  By definition, we have $H^1(A,M)=||A\to K(M,1)||_0$ and therefore that $A\to K(M,1)$ is connected.
  For $x:K$ let $E_x$ denote the fiber of $e$ over $x$, then $E_x$ is a $M$-torsor or in other words an element of $K(M,1)$.
  So $E\circ f:A\to K(M,1)$ and we have $|| E\circ f = (\_\mapsto M) ||$ by the connectedness noted above.
  This means that the dependent type $E\circ f$ merely has a section, since $(\_\mapsto M)$ has a section.
  This proves existence of the dotted map.
  \item By \cite{diffgeo-article}, we know that the differential of $\tilde{f}$ is such a linear map,
  but a direct computation is also possible, which we will carry out in the following.
  
  Let $A$ and $C$ be given by $A=\Spec R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(P_1,\dots,P_r)$ and $B=\Spec R[Y_1,\dots,Y_m]/(Q_1,\dots,Q_s)$.
  $\tilde{f}$ is represented by a homomorphism $\varphi$ between these $R$-algebras.
  Choosing lifts of the finitely many $\varphi(Y_i)$ we get polynomials $N_1,\dots,N_m$
  such that for all $j$ we have $Q_j(N_1,\dots,N_m)\in (P_1,\dots,P_r)$.
  Let $L_1,\dots,L_m$ be given by the linear parts of $N_1,\dots,N_m$.
  Then by analysing the degrees of the involved polynomials, we have $Q_j(L_1,\dots,L_m)\in (P_1,\dots,P_r)$, so the $L_1,\dots,L_m$ induce a homorphism
  \[
  \varphi_L: R[Y_1,\dots,Y_m]/(Q_1,\dots,Q_s) \to R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(P_1,\dots,P_r)
  \]
  which induces a linear map $f_L:A\to B$.
  Let us note that the difference $f_{NL}\coloneq \tilde{f}-f_L$ is given by monomials $S_i$ which are all of degree at least two.
  \item We know that $e\circ \tilde{f}$ is a linear map, so $e\circ f_{NL}$ is linear as well.
  Let $f_{NL}=\sum_i S_i$ be a decomposition into monomials with degrees $n_i\geq 2$ as above.
  For all $t:R$ and $x:A$ we have
  \[
  \sum_i te(S_i(x))=te(\sum_i S_i(x))=e(\sum_i S_i(tx))=e(\sum_i t^{n_i}S_i(x))=\sum_i t^{n_i}e( S_i(x))
  \]
  So by taking the difference we have a polynomial $P(t)\coloneq \sum_i te(S_i(x))-\sum_i t^{n_i}e( S_i(x))$ in $t$ with coefficients in $K$, such that $P(t)=0$ for all $t$.
  Since all $e(S_i(x))$ appear as coefficients of $P$, we can conclude $e\circ f_{NL}=0$, from $P$ being zero.

  Let $f:K\to R$ be an arbitrary linear map, then $f(P(t)):R\to R$ has to be the zero polynomial,
  so $f$ maps all $e(S_i(x))$ to zero.
  This means that the double dualization $K\to K^{\ast\ast}$ maps each $e(S_i(x))$ to zero,
  but by \Cref{coherent-double-dual-mono} it is injective, so all $e(S_i(x))$ are zero.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{coherent-kernels}
  The cokernel of a homomorphism between Adelman-modules is coherent.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $K,L$ be Adelman-modules and $f:K\to L$ a homomorphism.
  Choose finitely co-presented $R$-modules $A,B,C,D$ and homomorphisms to present $K$ and $L$ as cokernles.
  By the preceeding \Cref{maps-into-coherent-lift} there are lifts yielding this diagram:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A\ar[d]\ar[r,dotted] & C\ar[d,"r"] & \\
      B\ar[d,->>]\ar[r,dotted,"b",swap] & D\ar[d,->>]\ar[rd,->>,"g"] & \\
      K\ar[r,"f",swap] & L\ar[r,->>,"\mathrm{cok}",swap] & \mathrm{Cok}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Now we conclude by showing that the composition $g$ is the cokernel of a homorphism of the finitely co-presented $R$-modules $B\oplus C$ and $D$.
  By diagram-chasing, $b\oplus r:B\oplus C\to D$ surjects onto the kernel of $g$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{fp-kernel-dual-surjective}
  Let $M,N$ be finitely presented $R$-modules, $f:M\to N$ a homomorphism and $K$ its kernel,
  then the dual of the canonical map $K\to M$ is surjective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It is possible \rednote{TODO: add construction} to construct a diagram of the following shape, where the two left columns and all rows are exact:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A\ar[r,hook]\ar[d] & R^{m_1}\ar[r,"t"]\ar[d,"l"] & R^{n}\ar[d,"\id"] \\
      B\ar[r,hook]\ar[d,->>] & R^{m_2}\ar[r,"b"]\ar[d,->>] & R^{n} \\
      K\ar[r,hook] & M\ar[r] & N
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Then a linear map $L:K\to R$ restricts to a map $L_1:B\to R$ which is zero on $A$.
  By \cite{diffgeo-article}[Lemma 2.3.7] it is possible to extend $L_1$ to $L_2:R^{m_2}\to R$.
  $L_2$ will descend to $M$, if and only if it vanishes on the image of $r$.
  This will generally not be the case, but we can construct a linear correction $c:R^{m_2}\to R$ such that $L_2-c$ has this property.

  To construct $c$, let $c_0\coloneq L_2\circ l$, note that $c_0$ vanishes on $A$ and therefore extends to the image of $t$, to a linear map $c_1:\mathrm{im}(t)\to R$.
  By \cite{diffgeo-article}[Lemma 2.3.8], $c_1$ extends to a map $c_2:R^{n}\to R$.
  Now $c\coloneq c_2\circ b$ is a linear map on $R^{m_2}$, that is zero on $B$,
  so $L_2-c$ is still an extension of $L_1$ and $L_2-c$ vanishes on $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{coherent-self-dual}
  Let $K$ be a Adelman-module, then the canonical map $K\to K^{\ast\ast}$ is an isomorphism.
  In particular, dualization is an anti-equivalence of the category of Adelman-modules.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We can assume $K$ is in a sequence of $R$-modules:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A\ar[r,"f"] & B\ar[r,->>] & K
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  where $A,B$ are finitely co-presented and $B\to K$ is the cokernel of $f$.
  Taking double duals and using \Cref{fp-kernel-dual-surjective} and \Cref{coherent-double-dual-mono} we end up in this situation:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A\ar[r,"f"] & B\ar[r,->>]\ar[d,"\sim"] & K\ar[d,hook] \\
      & B^{\ast\ast} \ar[r,->>] & K^{\ast\ast} 
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  So $K\to K^{\ast\ast}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  \label{coherent-R-modules-abelian}
  The category of Adelman-modules is abelian.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By \Cref{coherent-kernels} Adelman-modules are closed under kernels.
  By the duality from \Cref{coherent-self-dual}, this also shows the closure under cokernels.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{fcp-projective-fp-injective}
  Any finitely co-presented $R$-module $A$ is projective in the category of of Adelman-modules:
  For all surjections $K\to K'$ with $K,K':\Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}$ and homomorphisms $f:A\to K'$ there exists a lift:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    & K\ar[d,->>] \\
    A\ar[r,"f",swap]\ar[ru,dotted,"\exists"] & K'
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
  Dually, any finitely presented $R$-module is injective in $\Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
   Using \Cref{coherent-fcp-lift-existence} and that for any Adelman-module like $K$, there is a finitely co-presented $R$-module surjecting onto it. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  By \cite[Theorem 1.15]{adelman-construction}, \Cref{fcp-projective-fp-injective} implies that the Adelman-modules are the free abelian category over the finite free $R$-modules.
  This means the Adelman-modules have the following universal property:
  For every abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and all additive functors $F:\Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ff}}\to \mathcal{A}$, there exists a unique exact functor $K$ like follows:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ff}}\ar[r]\ar[rd,"F",swap] & \Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}\ar[d,dotted,"K"] \\
    & \mathcal{A}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  \label{hom-closure}
  For Adelman-modules $M,N$, the $R$-module $\Hom_{\Mod{R}}(M,N)$ is an Adelman-module as well.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  The proof in \cite{lombardi-quitte}[Chapter IV, 4.12] works, if ``coherent'' is replaced by ``Adelman''.
  
  First we use their proof to show that for finitely presented $R$-modules $M,N$ the $R$-module $\Hom_{\Mod{R}}(M,N)$ is Adelman. Morphisms $f:M\to N$ are presented by squares:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
        R^m \ar[r]\ar[d,"\varphi"] & R^{m'}\ar[d,"\psi"] \\
        R^n\ar[r] & R^{n'}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
  So we have a finite free module of pairs of morphisms $(\varphi,\psi)$ and a submodule of pairs such that the square above commutes.
  This submodule $S$ is the kernel of a linear map and therefore Adelman.
  We have a surjection $\pi:S\to \Hom_{\Mod{R}}(M,N)$, so $\Hom_{\Mod{R}}(M,N)$ is Adelman,
  if $\pi$ is a cokernel of a map of Adelman-modules.
  This is the case, since there is a surjection onto $\ker{\pi}$ from the finite free $R$-module of linear maps which splitting the square:
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}
        R^m \ar[r]\ar[d,"\varphi"] & R^{m'}\ar[d,"\psi"]\ar[ld,"s"] \\
        R^n\ar[r] & R^{n'}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
  Then we can reuse the same argument to show the statement of the remark.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is dualization an antiequivalence of coherent modules?
\item Are coherent modules closed under extension?
\item Are coherent modules closed under $\Hom$?
\item Are coherent modules closed under $\_\otimes\_$?
\item Does exponentiating with closed propositions preserves Adelman?
\item\label{finite-exp-closed} Are projective/proper/finite-scheme products of Adelman modules Adelman?
\item Are the cohomology groups of Adelman module bundles on projective schemes Adelman?
\item Is any Adelman-module strongly quasi-coherent?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Answers:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Yes.
\end{enumerate}
\item None so far
\item Yes, \cref{hom-closure}.
\item It could be possible to just use the result for finitely presented modules, by extending the extension properties above to bilinear maps.
\item Yes, by partial answer to \cref{finite-exp-closed}.
\item Partial answer:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Let $X$ be a finite scheme, i.e. $X$ an affine scheme such that $R^X$ is a finitely presented $R$-module.
  For any Adelman-module $M$, $M^X$ is Adelman: We can exponentiate the diagram witnessing that it is an Adelman-module.
  Exponentiating is left exact and since $M$ is wqc and $X$ affine, it is also right exact.
\item Let $M:X\to \Mod{R}_{\mathrm{ad}}$ for a finite scheme $X$. Then $(x:X)\to M_x$ would be a Adelman-module, if we have \cref{adelman-local}: By local choice, we get a cover $D(f_1),\dots,D(f_n)$ of $X$, such that coherence of $M$ is witnessed by a diagram $M\hookrightarrow N \to L$ with $N,L$ finitely presented. By \cite{draft}[Theorem 7.2.3], $(x:D(f_i))\to N_x$ and $(x:D(f_i))\to L_x$ are finitely presented $R^{D(f_i)}$-modules and therefore finitely presented $R$-modules and the dependent product is a left exact functor.
\end{enumerate}
\item None so far. It seems a bit much to ask, but it would be really great for Serre-Duality, so it should be worth it to try to adapt e.g.\ \cite[19.1.3]{vakil}.
\item No. The kernel $K$ of $2\cdot\_:R\to R$ can not be strongly quasi-coherent in general.
  So far there is only an external argument: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjq91Gc6Lo} around 1:10:00 states that strongly quasi-coherent modules are invariant under pullback. But in general $K$ can change between trivial and non-trivial on different stages. 
\end{enumerate}
