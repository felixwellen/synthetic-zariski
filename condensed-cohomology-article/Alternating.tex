In cohomology, instead of the \v Cech complex, sometimes the alternating and ordered variants are used. There is a standard proof that the alternating and ordered \v Cech cohomology agree with the standard \v Cech cohomology. In this section, we adapt the standard proof (as in for example \cite{stacks-project}{Section 01FG} \rednote{This proof actually ommits some details, maybe another reference might be better}) to work in our setting. Note that we do not require a well-order on our fibers, but only a linear order. The order we define is linear because of LLPO. 

\begin{definition}
  Let $q: S \twoheadrightarrow X$ be a \v Cech cover and $A: X \to Ab$. 
  We define the \textbf{alternating \v Cech sequence} $\check C_{alt} (X,q,A)$ as 
  $$
  \Sigma_{\alpha : \prod_{x:X} A_x^{q_x}}is-alt_1(\alpha) 
  \to 
  \Sigma_{\alpha : \prod_{x:X} A_x^{q_x^2}}is-alt_2(\alpha) 
  \to 
  \Sigma_{\alpha : \prod_{x:X} A_x^{q_x^3}}is-alt_3(\alpha) 
  \to 
  \cdots 
  \to 
  \Sigma_{\alpha : \prod_{x:X} A_x^{q_x^n}}is-alt_n(\alpha) 
  $$
  where $is-alt_n(\alpha)= \Pi_{\sigma: S_n} \left(\alpha(s_i) = sgn(\sigma) \cdot \alpha(s_{\sigma(i)})\right)$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $S$ be a Stone space. Then there merely exists a linear order $\leq$ on $S$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note that every Stone space can merely be seen as subset of $2^\N$, so it's sufficient to define a linear order or $2^\N$. 
  For $\alpha,\beta :2^\N$, define 
  $$
  \alpha<\beta:= \exists_{n:\N} \big(
    (\alpha_n < \beta_n)  \wedge 
    (\forall_{k<n} \alpha_k=\beta_k)\big)
  $$
  Thus $\alpha<\beta$ if there exists some first index $n$ such that $\alpha_n,\beta_n$ differ, and at this index $\alpha_n =0,\beta_n = 1$. 
  Then define $\alpha \leq \beta := \neg \beta < \alpha$. 
  Note that $<$ is an open relation, and hence $\leq$ is closed and $\alpha < \beta \leftrightarrow \neg (\beta \leq \alpha)$.
  
  We leave proofs of reflexivity and transitivity and antisymmetry of $\leq$ as an exercise to the reader. 

  We claim that $(\alpha \leq \beta) \vee (\beta \leq \alpha)$. By LLPO and Markov, it's sufficient to prove the double negation. So assume $(\alpha < \beta) \wedge (\beta < \alpha)$, note that there now exist two indices $n,m$ which are minimal so that $\alpha,\beta$ differ. By minimality, they are equal, but now both $\alpha_n,\beta_n$ have to be $0$, which means that they don't differ, which is the contradiction we require. 
\end{proof}  
\begin{remark}
  Note that totality of the order defined above implies LLPO. We conjecture that the existence of a linear order on Cantor space is equivalent to LLPO. 
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let $q: S \twoheadrightarrow X$ be a \v Cech cover and $A: X \to Ab$. Let $\leq$ be a linear order on $S$. 
  We define the \textbf{$\leq$-ordered \v Cech sequence} $\check C_{\leq} (X,q,A)$ as 
  $$
  \prod_{x:X} A_x^{q_x}
  \to 
  \prod_{x:X} A_x^{\Sigma_{s: q_x^2 } is-ord^\leq_2(s)}
  \to 
  \prod_{x:X} A_x^{\Sigma_{s: q_x^3 } is-ord^\leq_3(s)}
  \to 
  \cdots 
  \to 
  \prod_{x:X} A_x^{\Sigma_{s: q_x^n } is-ord^\leq_n(s)}
  $$
  where $is-ord^\leq_n(s_i)$ means that $s_1 \leq s_2 \leq \cdots \leq s_n$
  \rednote{TODO come up with better notation}
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  Let $q: S \twoheadrightarrow X$ be a \v Cech cover and $A: X \to Ab$. Let $\leq$ be a linear order on $S$. 
  Then there exists an isomorphism of sequences between the \v Cech sequence $\check C(X,q,A)$ and the $\leq$-ordered chech sequence $\check C_{\leq}(X , q, A)$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
  We define a retraction of the embedding
  $
  Sigma_{s:(q_x)^n} is-ord_n^\leq(s) \hookrightarrow (q_x)^n
  $ 
  Given any sequence $s:(q_x)^n$, using the linear order and induction on $n$, we can define an ordered sequence $o(s)$ with the same terms as $s$. This induces a retraction on 
\end{proof}
