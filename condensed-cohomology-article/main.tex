\title{Cohomology in Synthetic Stone Duality}

\begin{document}

\author{Felix Cherubini, Thierry Coquand, Freek Geerligs and Hugo Moeneclaey}

\maketitle

Going toward an article, the main goal being showing $H^n(\I,A)=0$ for all $A$ countably presented, an auxiliary goal being showing that all of Barton-Commelin axioms for condensed type theory hold in synthetic Stone duality.

\section{Cohomology}
In this section, we show that for $X$ compact Hausdorff and $A$ overtly discrete, 
the $n$-th chomology $H^n(X,A)$ agrees with the \v Chech cohomology $\check H^n(X,Y,A)$ for any \v Chech cover $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$ (a \v{C}hech cover is a surjective maps whose fibers are merely inhabited Stone spaces).
