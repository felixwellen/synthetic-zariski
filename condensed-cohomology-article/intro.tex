In \cite{synthetic-stone-duality}, the authors introduced the theory of synthetic Stone duality (SSD). This theory gives a synthetic way to describe compact Hausdorff and overtly discrete types as closed and open quotients of Stone spaces and countable sets respectively. 
For \rednote{a variation of} a \v Chech cover, we showed that that for $X$ compact Hausdorff, the first cohomology group of $X$ with values in $\mathbb Z$ agrees with the first \v Chech cohomology group. In this paper, we generalize this result to the $n$-th cohomology group of $X$ with values in any dependent overtly discrete Abelian group $X \to \AbGroup_{\ODisc}$. 
As an application, we show that the unit interval in SSD is acyclic. 
Furthermore, we show all of the axioms of Barton and Commelin \cite{bc24} hold in SSD. In particular, we show a generalized version of Scott continuity between compact Hausdorff and overtly discrete spaces.
