\begin{document}
\maketitle
%We present some work in progress, 
%applying lessons about the Zariski topos from synthetic algebraic geometry \cite{draft} 
%to the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%Specifically, we 
%We propose an axiomatization of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}
%within a univalent homotopy type theory, 
%similar to the axiomatization of Zariski (higher) topos in synthetic algebraic geometry 
%\cite{draft}. 
We propose a variation of
the axiomatization of Zariski (higher) topos in synthetic algebraic geometry \cite{draft}
to an axiomatization of (separable) Stone spaces, with Stone duality,
within a univalent homotopy type theory.  This satisfies LLPO, and is reminiscent
of the notion of light condensed sets, \cite{Scholze}. 
This can also be seen as a refinement of the work in \cite{XuE13}

%\section{Axioms} 
We denote the type of countably presented Boolean algebras by $\Boole$.
Given a Boolean algebra $B$, we define $Sp(B)$, the spectrum of $B$ as the set of 
Boolean morphisms from $B$ to $2$. 
 A type of the form $Sp(B)$ for $B:\Boole$ is called Stone.


 Two motivating examples of elements of $\Boole$ are as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item $C$ is the free Boolean algebra on countably many generators $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. 
     The corresponding set $Sp(C)$ is Cantor space $2^\mathbb N$. 
   \item The Boolean algebra $ B_\infty$ is given by the quotient of $C$ by the relations $p_n\wedge p_m = 0$ for $n\neq m$. 
 The corresponding set $Sp(B_\infty)$ is $\Noo$. 
% the set of binary-sequences which hit $1$ at most once. 
  \end{itemize} 

\begin{axiom}[Stone duality]
  For any countably presented Boolean algebra, there is an isomorphism $B \simeq 2^{Sp(B)}$
\end{axiom}
It follows from Stone duality that being Stone is a proposition and $Sp$ defines an embedding from $\Boole$ 
to any universe $\mathcal U$. We denote call its image $\Stone$. 

Both $\Stone$ and $\Boole$ have a natural structure of a category, and 
Stone duality gives that these categories are anti-equivalent. 

Furthermore Stone duality gives us that any map from $X:\Stone$ to $\mathbb N$ is uniformly continuous
when we endow $X$ with the topology generated by decidable subsets. 

\begin{axiom}[Surjections are Formal Surjections]
  A map $Sp(B')\to Sp(B)$ is surjective iff the corresponding map $B \to B'$ is injective.
\end{axiom} 
%Note that in the category of Boolean algebras, a map is injective iff it is mono. 
%Hence the above axiom can also be stated as surjections being exactly epimorphisms. 
%Note also that if 1\neq 0, then 2 -> B is injective, hence Sp(B) -> 2 surjective, hence
%Sp(B) inhabited. 
%\begin{axiom}[Inhabited spectra of nontrivial algebras]
%  For any $B:\Boole$ with $1 \neq 0$, $Sp(B)$ is merely inhabited. 
%\end{axiom} 
%\begin{axiom}[Stone truncation]
%  For any $X: \Stone$ we have $\neg \neg X \to  ||X||$.
%\end{axiom} 
In particular, this axiom tells us that if $B$ is nontrivial, 
$Sp(B)$ is merely inhabited.
%
%
The sum of the maps
$\Noo \to \Noo$
%$\mathbb N_\infty \to \mathbb N_\infty$ 
sending $n$ to $2n,2n+1$ respectively
is surjective but has no section. 
This implies that $\Noo$ is not projective and LLPO holds. 
However, the negation of WLPO follows from Axiom 1.  

\begin{axiom}[Local choice]
  Given $X$ Stone, $E,F$ arbitrary types, a map $E \to F$ and $E\twoheadrightarrow F$ surjective, 
  there is some $Y$ Stone,
    a surjection $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$ and a map $Y\to E$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{equation*}\begin{tikzcd}
      Y \arrow [d, two heads,dashed] \arrow [r,dashed] & E \arrow[d,""',two heads]\\
      X \arrow[r] & F
    \end{tikzcd}\end{equation*}  
\end{axiom} 

\begin{axiom}[Dependent Choice]
  Given a family of types $E_n$ and $R_n:E_n\rightarrow E_{n+1}\rightarrow {\mathcal U}$ such that
  for all $n$ and $x:E_n$ there exists $y:E_n$ with $p:R~x~y$ then given $x_0:E_0$ there exists
  $u:\Pi_{n:\N}E_n$ and $v:\Pi_{n:\N}R~(u~n)~(u~(n+1))$ and $u~0 = x_0$.
\end{axiom}
%
%We are working on the proof that these axioms can be verified in the interpretation of HoTT in the topos of light condensed sets. We have checked that the results of lectures 2 and 3 of \cite{Scholze} follow from these axioms. 
%In particular, we can prove that $\ints[\Noo]$ is projective in the category of Abelian groups. 
%
We are working on the proof that these axioms can be verified in a model of HoTT, similar
to the model presented in \cite{draft}.
