We define étale, smooth and unramified schemes and maps in synthetic algebraic geometry in a novel way using what we call \emph{closed dense propositions} (\Cref{def-etale-closed-dense}).
This is an instance of a general phenomenon in synthetic reasoning, that concepts which are usually defined locally can be defined pointwise or on the level of propositions.
While describing the infinitesimal structure of schemes in section 2, we also point out a curious discovery: there is a duality between finitely presented modules over the internal base ring $R$ and finitely copresented modules over the same ring (\Cref{dual-of-fcop-fp,double-dual-identity}).
The latter notion of finitely copresented modules is not very prominent in algebra, but appears naturally in the study of tangent spaces of schemes (\Cref{tangent-finite-copresented}).

We show that the new definitions agree with straightforward translations of the classical concepts (\Cref{connection-to-ega-definition}) and provide some characterizations using tangent spaces:
a map between schemes is unramified if and only if it induces injections on all tangent spaces and étale if and only if it induces isomorphisms (\Cref{unramified-map-characterisation,etale-schemes-iff-local-iso}). Furthermore, a map from a smooth scheme is smooth if and only if it induces surjections on tangent spaces (\Cref{smooth-schemes-iff-submersion}).

Finally, we show that unramified, étale and smooth schemes can be described very concretely in the expected way by conditions on the polynomials locally describing such schemes (\Cref{unramified-iff-locally-std-unramified,standard-etale-are-etale,standard-smooth-is-smooth}). An important intermediate result for the characterization of smooth schemes is that their tangent spaces are finite free $R$-modules (\Cref{smooth-have-free-tangent})
