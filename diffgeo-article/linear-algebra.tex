\subsection{Modules and infinitesimal disks}
The most basic infinitesimal schemes are the first order neighbourhoods in affine n-space $R^n$. Their algebra of functions is $R^{n+1}$, which is an instance of the more general construction below.

For any $R$-module $M$, there is an $R$-algebra structure on $R\oplus M$ with multiplication given by
\[(r,m)(r',m') = (rr',rm'+r'm)\]
Algebras of this form are called \emph{square zero extensions} of $R$, since products of the form $(0,m)(0,n)$ are zero.
By this property, for any $R$-linear map $\varphi:M\to N$ between modules $M,N$, the map $\mathrm{id}\oplus \varphi: R\oplus M\to R\oplus N$ is an $R$-algebra homomorphism. In particular, if $M$ is finitely presented, i.e.\ merely the cokernel of some $p:R^n\to R^m$ then $R\oplus M$ is the cokernel of a map between finitely presented algebras and therefore finitely presented as an algebra. 

\begin{definition}
  \index{$\D(M)$}
Given $M$ a finitely presented $R$-module, we define a finitely presented algebra structure on $R\oplus M$ as above and set:
\[\D(M)\colonequiv \Spec(R\oplus M)\]
This is a pointed scheme by the first projection which we denote $0$
and the construction is functorial by the discussion above.
\end{definition}

We write $\D(n)$ for $\D(R^n)$ so that for example:
\[\D(1) = \Spec(R[X]/(X^2)) = \{\epsilon:R\ |\ \epsilon^2=0\}\]

\begin{definition}\label{derivation-pointwise}
Assume given $M$ a finitely presented $R$-module and $A$ a finitely presented $R$-algebra with $x:\Spec(A)$. An $M$-derivation at $x$ is a morphism of $R$-modules:
\[d:A\to M\]
such that for all $a,b:A$ we have that:
\[d(ab) = a(x)d(b) + b(x)d(a)\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{tangent-are-derivation}
Assume given $M$ a finitely presented module and $A$ a finitely presented algebra with $x:\Spec(A)$. Pointed maps:
\[\D(M)\to_\pt (\Spec(A),x)\] 
correspond to $M$-derivations at $x$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Such a pointed map correponds to an algebra map:
\[f : A\to R\oplus M\]
where the composite with the first projection is $x$. This means that, for some module map $d:A\to M$ we have:
\[f(a) = (a(x),d(a))\]
We can immediately see that $f$ being a map of $R$-algebras is equivalent to $d$ being an $M$-derivation at $x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{equivalence-module-infinitesimal}
Let $M$, $N$ be finitely presented modules. Then linear maps $M \to N$ correspond to
pointed maps $\D(N) \to_\pt \D(M)$. 
%Explicitly, a linear map $g : M \to N$ corresponds to the pointed map $f \mapsto m \mapsto f(g(m))$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{tangent-are-derivation} such a pointed map corresponds to an $N$-derivation at $0:\D(M)$.

Such a derivation is a morphism of modules:
\[d:R\oplus M\to N\]
such that for all $(r,m),(r',m'):R\oplus M$ we have that:
\[d(rr',rm'+r'm) = rd(r',m')+r'd(r,m)\]
This implies $d(r,0) = 0$ for all $r : R$, so we obtain a section to the injective functorial action of $\mathbb{D}$ on linear maps.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Tangent spaces}
  \label{remark-sym-dual}

In classical algebraic geometry, the tangent sheaf is defined as the dual of the cotangent sheaf which is given affine locally by the universal module of derivations. We could copy this approach synthetically, but contrary to the classical picture, we can also define the tangent bundle and dualize to get the usual cotangent bundle. This mismatch with the classical theory comes from the fact that classical dualiuzation of $\mathcal O_X$-module sheaves is not the same as the dualization of $R$-module bundles we use.

We start with the definition of tangent spaces which is also used in synthetic differential geometry:

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a type and let $x:X$, then we define the \notion{tangent space} $T_x(X)$ \index{$T_x(X)$} of $X$ at $x$ by:
\[\{t:\D(1)\to X\ |\ t(0)=x\}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Given $f:X\to Y$ and $x:X$ we have a map\index{$df_x$}:
\[df_x : T_x(X)\to T_{f(x)}(Y)\]
induced by post-composition.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{An-dimension-n}
For all $x:R^n$ we have $T_x(R^n) = R^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $R^n$ is homogeneous we can assume $x=0$. By \Cref{tangent-are-derivation} we know that $T_0(R^n)$ corresponds to the type of linear maps
\[R[X_1,\cdots,X_n] \to R\]
such that for all $P,Q$ we have:
\[d(PQ) = P(0)dQ + Q(0)dP\]
which is equivalent to $d(1) = 0$ and $d(X_iX_j) = 0$, so any such map is determined by its image on the $X_i$ so it is equivalent to an element of $R^n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{from-D1-to-D2}
Given a scheme $X$ with $x:X$ and $v,w:T_x(X)$, there exists a unique:
\[\psi_{v,w} : \D(2)\to_\pt X\]
such that for all $\epsilon:\D(1)$ we have that:
\[\psi_{v,w}(\epsilon,0) = v(\epsilon)\]
\[\psi_{v,w}(0,\epsilon) = w(\epsilon)\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can assume $X$ is affine. Then $\D(2)\to_\pt X$ is equivalent to the type of $R^2$-derivations at $x$, but giving an $M\oplus N$-derivation is equivalent to giving an $M$-derivation and an $N$-derivation. Checking the equalities is a routine computation.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
For any scheme $X$ and $x:X$, we have that $T_x(X)$ is a module.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
There is a more conceptual proof given as \cite[Theorem 4.2.19]{david-orbifolds} which could be made to work with schemes -- we proceed by sketching a more tedious, explicit proof with less technical prerequisites.
We define scalar multiplication by sending $v$ to $t\mapsto v(rt)$.

Then for addition of $v,w:T_x(X)$, we define:
\[(v+w)(\epsilon) = \psi_{v,w}(\epsilon,\epsilon)\]
where $\psi_{v,w}$ is defined in \Cref{from-D1-to-D2}.

We omit checking that this is a module structure.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
For $f:X\to Y$ a map between schemes, for all $x:X$ the map $df_x$ is a map of $R$-modules.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Commutation with scalar multiplication is immediate.

Commutation with addition comes by applying uniqueness in \Cref{from-D1-to-D2} to show:
\[f\circ \psi_{v,w} = \psi_{f\circ v,f\circ w}\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{kernel-is-tangent-of-fibers}
For any map $f:X\to Y$ and $x:X$, we have that:
\[
\mathrm{Ker}(df_x) = T_{(x,\refl_{f(x)})}(\mathrm{fib}_f(f(x)))
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This holds because:
\[
(\mathrm{fib}_f(f(x)),(x,\refl_{f(x)}))
\]
is the pullback of:
\[
(X,x) \to (Y,f(x)) \leftarrow (1,*)
\]
in pointed types, applied using $(\mathbb{D}(1),0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tangent-finite-copresented}
Let $X$ be a scheme with $x : X$. Then $T_x(X)$ is a finitely
copresented $R$-module.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We can assume $X$ affine. For some map $P: R^m\to R^n$ we have $X=\mathrm{fib}_P(0)$.
By applying \Cref{kernel-is-tangent-of-fibers} we know that $T_x(X)$ is the kernel of $dP_x : T_x(R^m)\to T_0(R^n)$ for all $x:X$.
We conclude by \Cref{An-dimension-n}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  \label{tangent-bundle-scheme}
  Let $X$ be a scheme, then the tangent bundle $X^{\mathbb{D}(1)}$ is a scheme.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  We give two independent arguments, the first uses the lemma, the second is a direct computation:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Finitely copresented modules are schemes, since they are the common zeros of linear functions on $R^n$.
    So by the lemma, all tangent spaces $T_x(X)$ are schemes and
    \[
      X^{\mathbb{D}(1)}=\sum_{x:X}T_x(X)
    \]
    is a dependent sum of schemes and therefore a scheme.
  \item Let $X$ be covered by open affine $U_1,\dots,U_n$ then $U_1^{\mathbb{D}(1)},\dots,U_n^{\mathbb{D}(1)}$ is an open cover by double negation stability of opens.
    So we conclude by showing that for affine $Y=\Spec R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(f_1,\dots,f_l)$ the tangent bundle $Y^{\mathbb{D}(1)}$ is affine
    by direct computation:
    \begin{align*}
      Y^{\mathbb{D}(1)}&=\Hom_{\Alg{R}}(R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(f_1,\dots,f_l), R\oplus \epsilon R) \\
                       &= \{(y_1,\dots,y_n):R\oplus \epsilon R \mid \forall_i. f_i(y_1,\dots,y_n)=0\} \\
                       &= \{(x_1,\dots,x_n,d_1,\dots,d_n):R^{2n} \mid \forall_i. f_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0\text{ and } \sum_j d_j\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial X_j}(x_1,\dots,x_n) =0\} 
    \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
For $X$ a type and $p : X$ a point, the \notion{cotangent space} at $p$ is the
$R$-linear dual $T_p X^\star$ of the tangent space $T_p X$.
\end{definition}

If $X$ is a scheme, then by \cref{tangent-finite-copresented} the cotangent spaces of $X$
are finitely presented.
We will not use the following definition and remark in the rest of this article, but included them to show a connection to the classical theory.
See \cite[p. 172]{Hartshorne} or \cite[p. 573]{vakil} for the classical theory.

\begin{definition}
For $A$ an $R$-module, there is a universal derivation $d : A \to \Omega_{A/R}$. We call elements of the type $\Omega_{A/R}$ \notion{KÃ¤hler differentials}.
\end{definition}

That is, $\Omega_{A/R}$ is generated as an $A$-module by symbols
$df$ for $f : A$, subject to relations $d = r \cdot df$ for $r : R$ and
$d(fg) = f \cdot dg + g \cdot df$.
It can be seen that if $A$ is finitely presented as an $R$-algebra,
then $\Omega_{A/R}$ is finitely presented as an $A$-module.
Classically, the sheaf $\Omega_{A/R}$ is the cotangent bundle.
Synthetically, it is enough to show this pointwise on $\Spec A$ by \cite[Theorem 8.2.3]{draft}.
To apply this theorem, we first turn $\Omega_{A/R}$ into an $R$-module bundle on $\Spec A$: For $p:\Spec A$, let $\Omega_{A/R,p}$ be the type of $R$-derivations at $p$, as defined in \Cref{derivation-pointwise} -- this agrees with tensoring $\Omega_{A/R,p}$ with $R$ using the evaluation at $p$, which is the general construction used in \cite[Theorem 8.2.3]{draft}. 

\begin{remark}
For all $p:\Spec A$, we have $\Omega_{A/R,p}\simeq T_p X^\star$ and therefore also $\Omega_{A/R}\simeq \prod_{x:\Spec A}T_p X^\star$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
We need to show that for $p : X$,
   we have an isomorphism of $R$-modules
   \[ T^\star_p X\simeq\Omega_{A/R,p}=\Omega_{A/R} \otimes_A R .\]
By \Cref{tangent-are-derivation} the tangent space $T_p X$ corresponds to derivations
$A \to R$, where the $A$-module structure on $R$ is obtained by evaluating at $p$.
These derivations correspond to $A$-module maps $\Omega_{A/R} \to R$, by the universal property
of KÃ¤hler differentials. In \Cref{double-dual-identity}, we will see that double dualization is an isomorphism for finitely (co-)presented $R$-modules, so we can conclude by dualizing.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Infinitesimal neighbourhoods}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a set with $x:X$. The \notion{first order neighborhood} $N_1(x)$ \index{$N_1(x)$}is defined as the set of $y:X$ such that there exists an finitely generated ideal $I\subseteq R$ with $I^{2}=0$ and:
\[I=0 \to x=y\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{first-order-square-zero}
Assume $x,y:R^n$, then $x\in N_1(y)$ if and only if the ideal generated by the $x_i-y_i$ squares to zero.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let us denote $I$ the ideal generated by the $x_i-y_i$ so that $x=y$ if and only if $I=0$. 

If $I^2=0$ then it is clear that $y\in N_1(x)$.

Conversely if $J=0 \to I=0$ then we have that $I\subset J$ by duality so that $J^2=0$ implies $I^2=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{first-order-schemes}
Let $X$ be a scheme with $x:X$. Then $N_1(x)$ is an affine scheme. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $x\in U$ open in $X$, we have that $N_1(x)\subset U$ so that we can assume $X$ affine.

This means $X$ is a closed subscheme $C\subset R^n$. Then by \Cref{first-order-square-zero}, we have that $N_1(x)$ is the type of $y:R^n$ such that $y\in C$ and for all $i,j$ we have that $(x_i-y_i)(x_j-y_j) = 0$, which is a closed subset of $C$ so it is an affine scheme.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A pointed scheme $(X,*)$ is called a \notion{first order (infinitesimal) disk} if for all $x:X$ we have $x\in N_1(*)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{N1-functor}
  $N_1$ extends to a functor from pointed schemes to first order disks.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since for $x:X$, $N_1(x)$ is just a subspace the functoriality is clear once we know that the defining relation of first order disks is preserved by functions between schemes.
  It is enough to consider $f:X\to Y$ for affine $X,Y\subseteq R^n$.
  So let $x,y:X$ such that $y\in N_1(x)$. Then for $\epsilon:=x-y$ we have $e_ie_j=0$ for all $i,j$ and
  \[ f(x)-f(y)=f(x)-f(x+\epsilon)=f(x)-(f(x) + df_x\epsilon)=-df_x\epsilon\]
  which means that $f(y)\in N_1(f(x))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{disk-are-infinitesimal}
A pointed scheme $(X,*)$ is a first order disk if and only if there exists a finitely presented module $M$ such that:
\[(X,*) = (\D(M),0)\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First we check that for all $M$ finitely presented and $y:\D(M)$ we have that $y\in N_1(0)$. Let $m_1,\cdots, m_n$ be generators of $M$, then consider $d:M\to R$ induced by $y$, then $y=0$ if and only if $d=0$ and for all $i,j$ we have that:
\[d(m_i)d(m_j) = 0\]
This means that $I = (d(m_1),\cdots,d(m_n))$ has square $0$ and $I=0$ implies $y=0$ so that $y\in N_1(0)$.

For the converse we assume $X$ a first order disk, by \Cref{first-order-schemes} we have that $X$ is affine and pointed, up to translation we can assume $X\subset R^n$ closed pointed by $0$. Since $X$ is a first order disk we have that $X\subset N_1(0)$ and by \Cref{first-order-square-zero} we have $N_1(0) = \D(R^n)$.

This means there is an f.g.\ ideal $J$ in $R\oplus R^n$ such that $X=\Spec(R\oplus R^n / J)$.
But $0$ corresponds to the first projection from $R\oplus R^n$, so that $0\in X$ means that if $(x,y)\in J$ then $x=0$, so that $J$ corresponds uniquely to an f.g.\ sub-module $K$ of $R^n$ and:
\[X = \Spec(R\oplus (R^n/K)) = \D(R^n/K)\] 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
  Let $M^\star\colonequiv \Hom_{R}(M,R)$ denote the $R$-linear dual of an $R$-module $M$.
\end{definition}

While it is clear that the dual of a finite presentation yields a finite copresentation, the reverse is not true in general, but holds with the duality axiom.
We will give a proof of this fact in \Cref{dual-of-fcop-fp}, which will need the following two extension results.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{extend-from-kernel}
  Let $M\subseteq R^n$ be the kernel of a linear map between finite free $R$-modules.
  Then any linear map $M\to R$ can be extended to $R^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  First note that $M=\Spec(R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(l_1,\dots,l_m))$ is affine, where the $l_i$ are linear.
  Let $L:M\to R$ be $R$-linear and $P:R^n\to R$ be given by taking a preimage under the quotient map $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]\to R[X_1,\dots,X_n]/(l_1,\dots,l_m)$,
  so we have $P_{\vert M}=L$.
  Let $P=\sum_{\sigma:\N^{\{1,\dots,n\}}}a_\sigma X_1^{\sigma(1)}\cdots X_n^{\sigma(n)}$.
  Now we can conclude by showing that the linear part of $P$
  \[
    K\colonequiv \sum_{\sigma:\N^{\{1,\dots,n\}}, \sum \sigma =1}a_\sigma X_1^{\sigma(1)}\cdots X_n^{\sigma(n)}
  \]
  extends $L$ as well, i.e.\ we will see $K_{\vert M}=L$.
  
  For all $x:M$ and $\lambda : R$ we have $L(\lambda x)=\lambda L(x)$ and therefore
  \[
    \sum_{\sigma:\N^{\{1,\dots,n\}}}\lambda^{\sum\sigma} a_\sigma x_1^{\sigma(1)}\cdots x_n^{\sigma(n)}=\lambda \sum_{\sigma:\N^{\{1,\dots,n\}}} a_\sigma x_1^{\sigma(1)}\cdots x_n^{\sigma(n)}
  \]
  By comparing coefficients as polynomials in $\lambda$, we have $\sum_{\sigma:\N^{\{1,\dots,n\}}, \sum \sigma \neq 1}a_\sigma x_1^{\sigma(1)}\cdots x_n^{\sigma(n)}=0$,
  which shows $K_{\vert M}=P_{\vert M}=L$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{extend-from-image}
  Let $\varphi:R^n\to R^m$ be $R$-linear, then any linear map $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)\to R$ on the image of $\varphi$ can be extended to $R^m$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\footnote{This proof is due to Thierry Coquand.}
  Let $(a_{ij})_{ij}$ be the coefficients of the matrix representing  $\varphi$ with respect to the standard basis.
  Then the image of $\varphi$ is generated by the columns of this matrix:
  \[
    \mathrm{im}(\varphi)=\left\{\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(a_{\_j})\mid x_j:R\text{, $1\leq j \leq n$}\right\}
  \]
  Let $L:\mathrm{im}(\varphi)\to R$ be $R$-linear and $l_j\colonequiv L((a_{\_j}))$.
  Applying $L$ to a general element of $\mathrm{im}(\varphi)$ and using linearity yields the following implication:
  \[
    \sum_{j=1}^n x_j(a_{\_j}) = 0 \Rightarrow \sum_{j=1}^n x_jl_j = 0
  \]
  The left side being 0 means that $m$ linear polynomials $P_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)\colonequiv\sum_{j=1}^n x_ja_{ij} $ vanish simulataneously.
  Let $Q(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ be the linear polynomial on the right side of the implication.
  Then the implication induces an inclusion between the common zeros of the $P_i$ and the zeros of $Q$,
  which by duality means that we have an inclusion of ideals $(Q)\subseteq (P_1,\dots,P_m)$ in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$.
  So there $b_i:R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ such that
  \[
     Q = \sum_{i=1}^m b_iP_i
   \]
   By comparing coefficients it is clear that the $b_i$ can be chosen to be in $R$, which we assume now.
   We define a $R$-linear map $K:R^m\to R$ by $K((y_1,\dots,y_m)^T)\colonequiv\sum_{i=1}^m b_iy_i$.
   $K$ extends $L$:
   \begin{align*}
     K\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(a_{\_j})\right)=&\sum_{i=1}^m b_i\sum_{j=1}^n x_ja_{ij} \\
     =& \sum_{i=1}^m b_iP_i(x_1,\dots,x_n) \\
     =& Q(x_1,\dots,x_n) \\
     =& \sum_{j=1}^n x_jl_j \\
     =& L\left(\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(a_{\_j})\right)
   \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{dual-of-fcop-fp}
  Let $M$ be finitely copresented, i.e.\ let there be an exact sequence
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      M\ar[r,hook, "\varphi"] & R^n\ar[r,"P"] & R^m
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Then the dual of this sequence is exact as well and $\varphi^\star$ is surjective.
  In particular, $M^\star$ is finitely presented.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Surjectivity of $\varphi^\star$ follows from \Cref{extend-from-kernel}.
  Linear maps $R^n\to R$ which vanish on $M$ factor over the image of $P$, so exactness at the middle of the dual sequence follows from \Cref{extend-from-image}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{double-dual-identity}
For any module $M$ finitely presented or finitely copresented, we have that $M^{\star\star}=M$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}\label{equivalence-modules-disks}
  The functor from finitely copresented modules to first order disks:
  \[M\mapsto \D(M^\star)\]
  is an equivalence, with inverse:
  \[(X,x)\mapsto T_x(X)\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
It is fully faithful by \Cref{equivalence-module-infinitesimal} and essentially surjective by \Cref{disk-are-infinitesimal}. To check for the inverse it is enough to check that:
\[T_0(\D(M^\star)) = M\]
But by \Cref{equivalence-module-infinitesimal} we have that $T_0(\D(M^\star)) = M^{\star\star}$ and we conclude by \Cref{double-dual-identity}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{duality-infinitesimal-tangent}
Let $X$ be a scheme with $x:X$, then we have:
\[N_1(x) = \D(T_x(X)^\star)\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{first-order-schemes} we have that $(N_1(x),x)$ is a first order disk. By \Cref{equivalence-modules-disks} it is enough to check that $T_x(N_1(x)) = T_0(\D(T_x(X)^\star))$. 

It is immediate that any map $f:\D(1)\to X$ uniquely factors through $N_1(f(0))$ so that $T_x(N_1(x)) = T_x(X)$, and we have that $T_0(\D(T_x(X)^\star)) = T_x(X)$ by \Cref{equivalence-modules-disks}.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Projectivity of finitely copresented modules}

Finitely copresented $R$-modules are projective objects in the category of finitely copresented $R$-modules, which means that all surjections between finitely copresented $R$-modules split.
The results in this section will not be used in the rest of the article.

\begin{lemma}\label{tangent-copresented-modules}
Let $M$ be a finitely copresented module, then we have $T_0(M) = M$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have that $M$ is the kernel of a linear map $P:R^m\to R^n$. By \Cref{kernel-is-tangent-of-fibers} we have that $T_0(M)$ is the kernel of:
\[dP_0:T_0(R^m)\to T_0(R^n)\]
but by \Cref{An-dimension-n} this is a map from $R^m$ to $R^n$, we omit the verification that $dP_0 = P$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Any finitely copresented module is projective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We consider $M,N$ finitely copresented with a surjective map:
\[f:M\to N\]
By \Cref{duality-infinitesimal-tangent} and \Cref{tangent-copresented-modules} we know that $\D(M^*) = N_1(0)$ in $M$, so that we have a commutative diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\D(M^\star)\ar[r]\ar[d] & M\ar[d,"f"]\\
\D(N^\star)\ar[r,"i"] & N\\
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Since $\D(N^*)$ has choice and $f$ is surjective there is $g:\D(N^\star)\to M$ such that $f\circ g = i$. Up to translation we can assume $g(0) = 0$.
Then we can factor $g$ through $\D(M^\star)$ as $N_1$ is functorial by \Cref{N1-functor}. This gives us a pointed section of the map:
\[\D(M^\star) \to \D(N^\star)\]
which by \Cref{equivalence-module-infinitesimal} gives a linear section of $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{neighborhood-tangent-correspondence-smooth}
A linear map between finitely copresented module:
\[f:M\to N\]
is surjective if and only if the corresponding pointed map:
\[\D(M^\star) \to \D(N^\star)\]
merely has a section preserving $0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \Cref{equivalence-module-infinitesimal} we know that:
\[\D(M^\star) \to \D(N^\star)\]
merely having a section preserving $0$ is equivalent to:
\[f:M\to N\]
merely having a section. But since any finitely copresented module is projective, this is equivalent to $f$ being surjective.
\end{proof}
