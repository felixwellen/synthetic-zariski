For $z:\bP^{19}$, let $C_z$ be the cubic given by using the components of $z$ as coefficients for a cubica form on $\bP^3$.
Then the typ of lines $L(C_z)$ in $C_z$ is projective.

\cite[Theorem 27.3.1]{vakil} seem to state something equivalent to:

\begin{lemma}
\label{line-on-cubic-deformation}
$L(C_z)$ is unramified.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\rednote{TODO: we just need to check that the proof works synthetically}
\end{proof}
