\title{Notes on a Synthetic Version of 27-lines}

\begin{document}


\author{(so far) Felix Cherubini, Jonas Höfer}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Attempt to reproduce the classic results that over an algebraically closed field,
  a smooth cubic in $\bP^3$ contains exactly 27 lines.
  The best version we can hope for synthetically, without any assumptions on the base ring,
  will probably involve an étale cover of the configuration space of cubics, such that the configuration space of lines in each cubic becomes a finite set of cardinality 27 after pulling back along that cover.
\end{abstract}

We follow \cite[Chapter 27]{vakil}.
