# Synthetic Mathematics

Mathematicians usually have an analytic approach to the mathematical objects they want to study: this means that they understand these objects as being constructed from more basic ones. The most basic objects are sets, for example the set of natural numbers. These can be used to construct rational numbers, then real numbers, followed by surfaces and so on. As these constructions are being piled up on top of each other, contemporary mathematical objects get more and more complicated. This means mathematicians have more and more to learn to access a new field, and formalising mathematical arguments gets more and more challenging.

As a way to bypass this increasing complexity, we use a synthetic approach to the mathematical objects we want to study: this means that we aim to design formal languages where these objects are basic ones. Homotopy type theory is a synthetic approach to homotopy theory, which is a theory of geometric objects up to deformation. Our project combines homotopy type theory with other synthetic methods.

# Synthetic Algebraic Geometry

In algebraic geometry, polynomial equations are studied using methods from geometry and algebra. These two fields have many links, the most basic being the correspondence between a space and the algebra of functions form that space to a fixed ring. In the usual analytic approach, this correspondence is made one-to-one by using a complicated notion of space. In our synthetic approach, this correspondence is assumed one-to-one as an axiom. We were able to reproduce many non-trivial algebraic geometry results with this synthetic approach.

# Synthetic Stone Duality

Basic analysis starts traditionally by analysing the convergence behaviour of sequences of real numbers. Eventually, the real number line is given a topology, which is a abstract structure capturing what it means for points of a space to be close. We study this subject synthetically using axioms which give the real numbers an intrinsic topology.

Furthermore, in combination with synthetic homotopy theory, we get a shortcut to a field called algebraic topology, which studies some topological spaces by algebraic properties of their homotopy types.
