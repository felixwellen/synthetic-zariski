# Synthetic Mathematics

Mathematicians usually construct complicated objects they want to study from more basic objects.
The most basic objects are sets, for example the set of natural numbers.
These can be used to construct integers, rational and real numbers, which can then be used to, for example, construct more advanced mathematical objects like surfaces.

This leads to increasing towers of constructions behind every contemporary mathematical concept,
which newcomers have to learn and which cause problems when mathematical arguments are formalized.

The synthetic mathematics that we study is a more direct approach where, for a fixed domain of mathematics, we use a special formal language which has the mathematical objects of interest among its basic notions.

Homotopy type theory is a synthetic language for homotopy theory, which is an abstract theory of the rough shapes of geometric objects.
One speciality of our project is that we combine this synthetic homotopy theory with other synthetic methods.

# Synthetic Algebraic Geometry

In Algebraic geometry, non-linear polynomial equations are studied using methods from geometry and algebra.
These two fields have many links, the most basic is passing from a space to the algebra of functions on the space with values in some given ring.
In traditional appraoches to the subject, this correspondence is more involved and a complicated notion of space needs to be used, to make it a one to one correspondence.
In our synthetic apporach, we start from this correspondence, by making it an axiom.
Together with our two other axioms, we were able to reproduce non-trivial results in algebraic geometry with this synthetic approach.

# Synthetic Stone Duality

Basic analysis starts traditionally by analysing the convergence behaviour of sequences of real numbers.
Eventually, the real number line is given a topology, which is a abstract structure capturing what it means for points of a space to be close.
We study this subject synthetically using axioms which give the real numbers an intrinsic topology.
Furthermore, in combination with synthetic homotopy theory, we get a shortcut to a field called algebraic topology,
which studies some topological spaces by algebraic properties of their homopty types.
