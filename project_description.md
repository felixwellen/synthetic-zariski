# Synthetic Mathematics

Mathematicians usually construct complicated objects they want to study from more basic objects.
The most basic objects are sets, for example the set of natural numbers.
These can be used to construct integers, rational and real numbers, which can then be used to, for example, construct more advanced mathematical objects like surfaces.

This leads to increasing towers of constructions behind every contemporary mathematical concept,
which newcomers have to learn and which cause problems when mathematical arguments need to be made completely formal.

The synthetic mathematics we study is a more direct approach, where, for a fixed domain of mathematics, a special formal language is used which has the objects of interest already as its most basic objects. 

# Synthetic Algebraic Geometry

Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of non-linear equations using methods from geometry and algebra.
One passes between spaces and algebra, by looking at the algebra of functions on a space.
In traditional appraoches to the subject, a complicated notion of space is used, to make the correspondence between function algebras and spaces one to one.
In our synthetic apporach, we use an axiom to force this correspondence directly.

# Synthetic Stone Duality

We successfully applied an analogous approach to topology.
Here, a correspondence of compact, totally disconnected Hausdorffspaces, which are also called Stone spaces, with boolean algebras is forced by one of our axioms.
