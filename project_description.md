# Synthetic Reasoning

The usual approach in mathematics is to construct objects of interest from the ground up.
So behind a complicated object like a surface there is a whole tower of constructions:
First, if real numbers are used to describe the surface, they may be constructed from the rational numbers which have to be constructed from the integers.
To arrive at the concept of a surface, there are still a couple of constructions using the real numbers.

The objects of interest in mondern mathematics often the product of a significantly longer chain of constructions as the one sketched above.
And understanding a sketch is not enough for a mathematician to work with those objects -- it is often neccessary to understand all the concepts along the way very well to be able to advance the state of the art, which means that new researchers have to study for a long time to join a field.

The idea of synthetic mathematics, as we use the term in our project, is to start with the concepts of interest and figure out a language which allows to reasone about them directly, without giving and understanding a tower of constructions.

# Synthetic Algebraic Geometry

Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of non-linear equations using methods from geometry and algebra.
One passes between spaces and algebra, by looking at the algebra of functions on a space.
In traditional appraoches to the subject, a complicated notion of space is used, to make the correspondence between function algebras and spaces one to one.
In our synthetic apporach, we use an axiom to force this correspondence directly.

# Synthetic Stone Duality

We successfully applied an analogous approach to topology.
Here, a correspondence of compact, totally disconnected Hausdorffspaces, which are also called Stone spaces, with boolean algebras is forced by one of our axioms.
